# Health Inequality Index

## Input Dataframes

Some input dataframes are too large to be stored in git and are available for download via Google Drive. To properly reproduce the projets, they should be added at the following paths:

- [`"UNPD Inequality Index All Countries/Input_Dataframes/Country_Data_1950-1985.xlsx"`](drivelink1)
- [`"UNPD Inequality Index All Countries/Input_Dataframes/Country_Data_1986-2019.xlsx"`](drivelink2)
